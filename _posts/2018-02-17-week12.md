So far our team has gotten acknowledged by Terasology's founder and leading developer, because of Dora's accepted pull request in which she fixed an axe that was backwards. Other than that, our team has created snow slabs and have gotten a good understanding of adding a block into the world and giving it characteristics.

My contributions were dependent on the understanding of Terasology's world rendering methodology as well as how 3D shapes are defined. I used Blender to create some JSON files that would render the correct shapes for an eight snow slab, a fourth snow slab, and a half snow slab. Then I added JSON files for each block to properly render the correct shape, texture, and give the block its characteristics.
