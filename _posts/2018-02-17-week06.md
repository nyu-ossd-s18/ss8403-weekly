Meeting: Wednesdays 5-7pm, and Saturdays 4-6pm

# Strengths

Our team's strengths are well suited for this project because we all took AIT and know JavaScript. 

# Weaknesses

Our team's weakness is that we don't have open source experience, so I believe it would be tough to start interacting with the community. 

# Milestones
 
- Go through Hello World tutorial
- Set up development environment
- Read contributing and related docs
- Interact with IRC chat
- Fix beginner bugs
 
# Open Data

 - Data Through Design
 - Maximizing the Value of Open Data APIs
