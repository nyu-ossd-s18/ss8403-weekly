# Google Open Source

I think it's nice that Google open sources so many of their projects. I think they understand the importance of open source. However, I had never heard of the Google open source projects before.

# Code of Conduct

I think a code of conduct is important to unite all the different types of people that contribute to the project. It establishes guidelines to prevent disputes. Other projects would also benefit from this type of document because it would help create a friendly and open environment for development.

# Team Progress

We switched projects from PDF.js to Terasology. We were able to triage a lot of issues for PDF.js and learn about its code structure, but we realized that there were not enough simple issues for us to work on. We were stuck. For Terasology, we all joined the IRC, set up the development environment, and read the contribution guidelines.
