# Wiki Contribution

 I selected the *chhurpi* wikipedia page because I really like chhurpi and wanted the Wikipedia page to be informative and accurate. Fortunately it was easy to contribute to this page because it was in the "Category:Food and drink articles needing attention to referencing and citation" category. Not only that, but because it is my personal interest, my knowledge about the subject helped me add to the article.

 First I made a small contribution by verifying the modification of two external links. Two links were modified by creating an archive to the links and I verified that the links were working and correct. Then, I added a common synonym to its description. Then I added information about its high protein content and its use as a dog food, and cited my sources.
