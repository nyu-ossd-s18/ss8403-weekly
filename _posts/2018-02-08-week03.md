# Wiki Contribution

 I selected the Chhurpi wikipedia page because I really like chhurpi and wanted the Wikipedia page to be informative and accurate. Fortunately it was easy to contribute to this page because it was in the "Category:Food and drink articles needing attention to referencing and citation" category.

 I made a small contribution by verifying the modification of two external links. Two links were modified by creating an archive to the links and I verified that the links were working and correct.
