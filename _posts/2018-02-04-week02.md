# Cathedral vs Bazaar

  The cathedral is a highly structured and orderly institution consisting of a group of people that are religious enough to attend, while a bazaar is a crowded mix of people with a variety of different origins and intents. Similarly, the traditional form of software development has a structure and a traditional order and planning that is followed, with only a particular subset of people (developers) taking part. While open source developement is less rigid in structure and consists of contributors from a variety of different backgrounds and agendas.
  I personally think I would feel more comfortable with the bazaar style of development because there is less rigidity and more collaboration with different people. Also there is less secrecy in a bazaar type development, so I would have open access to any code.
