## Pull Request

 [Pull request](https://github.com/joannakl/cs480_s18/pull/47)

I fork the repository in my own github. Then I cloned the repository.

> git clone https://github.com/suyasha0/cs480_s18.git

Then I created a new branch. 

> git checkout -b patch-1

Then I made changes on my local machine on that branch, committed my changes, and pushed to my remote fork.

> git commit -m "fixed #40"
> git push

Then I went to my fork on github.com and created a pull request. I added a bit more details in the decription section of the pull request.
