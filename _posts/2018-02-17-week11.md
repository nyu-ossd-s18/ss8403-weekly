I added a quarter snow slab to Terasology. First I had to learn about Terasology's world rendering and the way a block is defined. Then using Blender and Terasology's addon for it I was able to get a sense of how Terasology's x, y, z axis works. Some of the axis were the opposite of the ones on Blender. Testing what coordinates were the correct ones took a lot of testing and I realized how annoying testing 3D games is. I was able to get the snow slab in the game, and everything works as expected except for one bug: when placing a full-size block next to the slab, the right side of the slab disappears. I tried fixing this bug for many days and even found a similar previously-fixed bug on the Terasology github. However, I was unable to fix it and have decided to let the community handle it. I also reached out about it on the IRC chat, but the replies did not help me.
